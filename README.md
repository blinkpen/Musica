 Random Melody Generator.<br>
I created a user control called a Musica Block so you can dynamically generate as many as you need.
import a sound file of your choice. Musica Blocks will take care of pitch shifting to represent different notes for that sound.
generate the number of notes you want and generate a random melody. With 52 notes and 8 Scales and rest support. Adjust tempo, adjust the mount of notes, generate melody, and import new sound without affecting the other options. add new notes without affecting the existing ones when you increase note amount. remove notes when you decrease note amount.
Play melody. Protect notes from being changed when generating new melodies. Coming soon: stop playing and looping functions.
