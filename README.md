 Random Melody Generator.<br>
I created a user control called a `Musica Block` so you can dynamically generate as many as you need. Import a sound file of your choice. `Musica Blocks` will take care of pitch shifting to represent different notes for that sound. Generate the number of notes you want and generate a random melody. With 52 notes and 8 Scales and rest support. Adjust tempo, adjust the mount of notes, generate melody, and import new sound without affecting the other options. Add new notes without affecting the existing ones when you increase note amount. Remove notes when you decrease note amount without affecting the remaining ones, if any. Play melody. Protect notes from being changed when generating new melodies. Stop playing and looping functions.

History: I have created a simpler version of his years ago in VB.net and it used pre-recorded sounds for different notes and was limited to just 7 notes and 7 slots.
Since then it was my dream to create a custom user control so I could generate as many as I wanted which had a button to play the current sound for testing as well as a dropdown box to change the note, and also add the ability to just import one sound file and have the software pitch shift it to create the different notes for that sound. Now I am proud to announce that I have finally made this dream a reality, and in C# no less.
